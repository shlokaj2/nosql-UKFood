# nosql-UKFood

The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by 
the editors of a food magazine called Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics 
decide where to focus future articles.

I have added the Jupyter notebook starter files to the Resources folder and completed the assignment with both the starter files
appropriately filled out with code.
